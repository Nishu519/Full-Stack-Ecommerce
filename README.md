# Full Stack E-commerce Platform

A full stack e-commerce platform built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), designed to handle a high volume of users and transactions efficiently. Key features include user authentication, a product catalog, a shopping cart, and payment processing.

## Features

- **Efficient Search**: Implements optimized search algorithms for the product catalog to provide fast, relevant search results.
- **OOP Architecture**: Designed with modularity and reusability in mind, applying object-oriented principles for maintainable and scalable code.
- **Scalable Database**: Uses MongoDB (NoSQL) or MySQL (SQL) with an optimized schema to ensure efficient data management and scalability.
- **System Design**: Supports high traffic through load balancing and horizontal scaling strategies.
- **Modern Frontend**: Built with React to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Robust Backend**: Powered by Node.js and Express.js for handling server-side logic and API integration.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - JavaScript
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB / MySQL (based on project needs)
- **Additional Concepts**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - System Design Principles

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nishu519/full-stack-ecommerce.git
   cd ecommerce-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following information:
     ```plaintext
     NODE_ENV=development
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit the platform at `http://localhost:3000`.

## System Architecture

The platform is structured to optimize for scalability and high performance:

- **Frontend**: The React-based frontend is built for modularity and responsiveness.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express handle server-side logic and REST API creation.
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) or MySQL (SQL) is used based on scaling and consistency needs.
- **Load Balancing**: Load balancing enables horizontal scaling to support high traffic.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: The system design allows for easy horizontal scaling, handling a large number of users and requests concurrently.

## Outcome

This project showcases a solid understanding of:

- Full-stack development
- System design for scalability
- Building high-performance web applications
